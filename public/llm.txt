# Aaron Dsilva - Tech Lead & CTO | AI, Security & Full-Stack | Healthcare, SaaS & E-commerce

> I build secure, AI-powered systems as a Tech Lead and CTO. Full-stack development across React Native/Flutter apps to Node/Rails/Laravel backends with RAG pipelines. Over 8 years shipping production systems across healthcare (100+ hospitals, FDA/HIPAA), e-commerce (multi-vendor marketplaces), and security (ISO 27001 platforms).

I write code, architect infrastructure, lead teams, and ship products that work. I implement AI/RAG systems (Neo4j, Pinecone, Claude API) into production, fix security issues from pen tests (actual code, not reports), and build systems that pass audits: HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, FDA, ISO 27001. Worked with King's College London, Johnson & Johnson, and European hospital networks across US, Europe, and India.
